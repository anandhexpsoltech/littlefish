Finally, after dozens of wpDiscuz users requests weâ€™re releasing the Advanced Likers addon.
This is a light solution for people who wants to display comment likers list and encourage 
commenters with some reputation titles and badges. wpDiscuz Advanced Likers addon opens a 
pop-up window with all voters/likes of current comment. You can see positive and negative 
voters separately. The light user reputation system allows to display different rating titles 
and badges based on amount of received likes.
